    <h1>We finally made it to the mainframe...</h1>
    <h2>and all we got were these stupid colors...</h2>

    <p>Here's the thing, We've bamboozled and scammed our customers. This isn't going to be a problem. We have their bank info, full names, and socials in our possesion.
        Here's an issue. There's absolutely nothing we can do with the information. We have to work harder. Our next plan, hack into the Seattle School District. With 
        Fornite V-Bucks as bait, these kids won't expect anything when we SCAM THEM. It is soon our time, to be a big shot. I've attached a photo of how were going to handle this.
