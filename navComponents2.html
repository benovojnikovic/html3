                    <p>GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration.It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. 
                    It's free, easy to use, and has become central in the movement toward open-source software. 
                    It also enables developers to upload their own code files to collaborate with their fellow developers. 
                    There are millions of programmers and hobbyists that download, review, and evaluate each other's workGitHub is a for-profit company that offers a cloud-based Git repository hosting service. 
                    Essentially, it makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboratation,
                    GitHub's interface is user-friendly enough so even novice coders can take advantage of Git. 
                    Without GitHub, using Git generally requires a bit more technical savvy and use of the command line.
                    As a company, GitHub makes money by selling hosted private code repositories, as well as other business-focused plans that make it easier for organizations to manage team members and security. 
                    We utilize Github extensively at Kinsta to manage and develop internal projects.
